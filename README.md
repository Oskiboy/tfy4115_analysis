# TFY4115 Analysis

This is our analysis of a ball rolling on a parabola shaped track. We get our data from Tracker, tracking the ball with a high speed camera.

After creating several datasets we run them through the main program here and we get a bunch of data that we can analyze as we please. For our purpose we used it to create an exponential regression for the energy lost by the ball in our track.
